Assignment 4

Reviewer 1
1. Could not get code to run. Examined code and could not detect any errors.
    Problems most likely due to titanium.

2. There are two windows set up in the code. Code seems to be written correctly.

3. Buttons are written to move between the windows. Seems to be written properly.

4. Could not test in multiple devices for size changes, due to emulator issues previously discussed with professor.
